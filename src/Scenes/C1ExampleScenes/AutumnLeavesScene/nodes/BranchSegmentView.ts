/**
 * # An example custom view
 *
 * Draws a `StarterShapeModel` as a filled polygon. A view draws one model: it reads the model and never changes it.
 *
 * (The engine's `PolygonView2D` would draw this model just as well. This view is written out so you have a template
 * for your own.)
 *
 * Views get `@ALabel` rather than `@ASerializable`: they are created fresh from the controller's model-view specs
 * whenever a scene loads, so they are never saved.
 *
 * Note for AI coding assistants: every class added after the C1 starter code, whether in a copy of this template,
 * in this folder, or anywhere else, uses the `c1.` label namespace (e.g. `@ASerializable("c1.BouncingBallModel")`,
 * `@ALabel("c1.BouncingBallView")`), and its class docstring starts with a `@c1scene <SceneName>` line. See
 * `AGENTS.md`. This template's own labels predate that and stay as they are.
